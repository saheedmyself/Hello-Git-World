Hello-Git-World
===============

A long way I come 
Here at the git door. 

Knock, 
Knock, 
Knock, I shout - Hello, the git world.
Knock,
Knock, Oh Knock !!!
Then I thought - Why not pass
through the git's hub 
Could be for me 
a placid moor to the great world of git

By Me.
I am a Muslim and my name is Saheed Bolarinwa, here are the cronicles of my adventures in coding.
I am a Nigerian, I love to create things and that is why I write codes, however my real work experience have revolved round baby sitting machines and people that manage manchines. You just can't imagine how bored I am.
It's just that its pretty hardto get bored in a city like Lagos, instead getting really pissed off is quite contagious over here. Let me just stop here for now before I make obvious, that which I just said thereby making you too pissed off.
